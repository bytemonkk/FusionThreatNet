## Overview

FusionThreatNet is a hybrid anomaly detection framework designed to identify malicious activities and abnormal behavioral patterns in cybersecurity environments.

The framework integrates:

* Transformer-Based Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
* Attention Fusion Network
* Isolation Forest
* One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM)
* Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
* Latent Space Feature Learning
* Reconstruction Error Analysis
* Risk Scoring Engine
* Alert Prioritization System
* Ensemble-Based Anomaly Detection

The proposed framework combines deep representation learning with traditional anomaly detection techniques to improve attack detection, risk estimation, and decision support for cybersecurity monitoring systems.

## Dataset Information

To evaluate the proposed FusionThreatNet framework, a synthetic cybersecurity dataset comprising **10,000 samples** was generated to simulate realistic enterprise security environments and anomalous attack scenarios.

The dataset contains a diverse set of structured cybersecurity records, including:

* Network Traffic Records
* User Authentication and Activity Logs
* Security Events and Alerts
* System Monitoring Metrics
* Mixed Numerical and Categorical Features

The generated dataset incorporates both normal and anomalous behavioral patterns to emulate real-world cybersecurity operations. Numerical attributes capture system and network statistics, while categorical attributes represent user actions, event types, protocols, authentication outcomes, and security-related activities.

Each sample is associated with a binary target variable:

| Label | Description                 |
| ----- | --------------------------- |
| 0     | Normal Activity             |
| 1     | Attack / Anomalous Activity |

The synthetic dataset was specifically designed to evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection, latent feature learning, risk assessment, and alert prioritization capabilities within the proposed FusionThreatNet framework.

Due to repository size considerations, the complete dataset is not included in this repository.

## Traditional Anomaly Detection Models

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/anomaly_models.png" width="100%">
</p>

The framework evaluates multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms:

* Isolation Forest
* One-Class SVM
* Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

Each model generates anomaly scores that are subsequently fused through an attention-based ensemble mechanism.

The Transformer-based Variational Autoencoder learns latent representations from cybersecurity data while preserving long-range feature dependencies.

Key components:

* Transformer Encoder
* Variational Latent Space
* Transformer Decoder
* Reconstruction Error Analysis

## Risk Scoring Strategy

The framework converts anomaly scores into actionable cybersecurity intelligence.

### Risk Score

```text
Risk Score = Probability × 100
```

### Alert Levels

| Alert Level | Risk Score Range |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| LOW         | 0 – 39           |
| MEDIUM      | 40 – 64          |
| HIGH        | 65 – 84          |
| CRITICAL    | 85 – 100         |

## Why FusionThreatNet?

Modern cybersecurity environments generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data where malicious activities are often rare, evolving, and difficult to identify using traditional rule-based systems.

FusionThreatNet addresses these challenges through a hybrid learning strategy that combines Transformer-VAE representation learning with multiple anomaly detection algorithms and attention-guided ensemble fusion. The framework not only detects attacks but also quantifies risk and prioritizes alerts, enabling more effective security monitoring and decision-making.

## Goal

Detect malicious activities accurately, assess cybersecurity risks, prioritize alerts, and provide actionable intelligence through a hybrid Transformer-VAE and Attention Fusion framework.
